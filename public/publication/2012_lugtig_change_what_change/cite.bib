  abstract = {A primary objective of panel studies is to analyze change. The same questionnaire                     is used to compare data recorded at various times. Panel designs assume that the                     meaning of the questions and the concept of interest are stable over time.                     Analyses of measurement invariance often show the contrary. A qualitative part                     supplementing a panel survey can help us understand this phenomenon. In this                     study, 261 first-year psychology students completed questionnaires about their                     study motivation on two occasions; we interviewed some students as well. The                     survey showed that study motivation is not invariant over time. The qualitative                     data converged with the quantitative outcomes and explained the lack of                     invariance by the studentsâ€™ overall transition during the first study                     year. We conclude that mixing quantitative and qualitative research methods for                     panel studies helps us understand change in constructs over time. We can study                     change at the macrolevel and better understand such change at the                     microlevel.},
