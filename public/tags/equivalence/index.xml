      <title>Designing mixed-mode surveys</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend is the deadline for submitting a presentation proposal to this year&amp;rsquo;s conference of the European Survey Research Association. That&amp;rsquo;s one the two major the conferences for people who love to talk about things like nonresponse bias, total survey error, and mixing survey modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in previous years, it looks like the most heated debates will be on mixed-mode surveys. As survey methodologists we have been struggling to combine multiple survey modes (Internet, telephone, face-to-face, mail) in a good way. And we no longer can rely on just one survey mode to do a good survey. Many people don&amp;rsquo;t have Internet, or landline phones, and face-to-face modes are becoming too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we start mixing survey modes, we run into all kinds of problems. Different people respond in different survey modes, leading to differences in the variables we&amp;rsquo;re interested in (selection effects). And we also know that people respond differently to the same survey question when asked in two different modes (measurement or &amp;lsquo;mode&amp;rsquo;  effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been trying to assess the size of  selection and mode effects in mixed-mode surveys for a long time. I have written about this issue earlier, and although we have made progress, I don&amp;rsquo;t think we will ever be able to &amp;lsquo;correct&amp;rsquo; for differences between survey modes. That is because the sizes of selection and mode effects will always differ from survey to survey, depending on the topic of the study, and the population studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I suggest we try something different. We don&amp;rsquo;t we try to make survey modes themselves similar? If you think of combining the Internet, with face-to-face (two very different modes), these could be some ways to make the surveys equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Approach people in the same way. For example, use advance letters in both modes, and then call respondents to either make an appointment (Face-to-face), or ask for an e-mailaddress and do an Internet interview. Stupid it may sound, but mixed-mode surveys or experiments often change the entire protocol, so we have no idea what is caused by what.&lt;br&gt;
- Use showcards in a face-to-face survey for sensitive questions and let the respondent self-complete them, like they do on the Internet&lt;br&gt;
- Use a Virtual Reality interviewer on an Internet survey for difficult questions, to help the respondent answering questions.&lt;br&gt;
- Use an audio recording feature on the Internet, so respondents can give answers in the same way as they do in Face-to-face surveys&lt;br&gt;
- Use short and simple questions that can easily be asked in any survey mode in more or less the same manner. This implies minimizing the number of response categories to only a few for any question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, this approach is not fault free, and I do see lots of practical issues. I do think however that this is a better way to move forward than just trying fix up the mess with statistics after the data collection. These correction methods will always be necessary, but relying on them too much puts too much faith in statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>mixed-mode designs: cognitive equivalence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of separating out mode effects from nonresponse and noncoverage effects through statistical modeling, it is perhaps better to design our mixed-mode surveys in such a way so that mode effects do not occur. The key principle in preventing the mode effects from occurring, is to make sure that questionnaires are cognitively equivalent to respondents. This means that no matter in which survey mode the respondents participate, they would give the same answer. In my opinion, there are two ways to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. choose a mix of modes that lead to a cognitively equivalent survey process. The survey process is very different in a questionnaire administered in a telephone vs. an Internet mode. Some mode combinations are can however be combined without great differences between they survey process across the modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- combine face-to-face with telephone modes: the mode of communication is in both modes aural with an interviewer asking and recording answers. The only difference is that the interviewer is physically present in the face-to-face survey, and not in the telephone survey.&lt;br&gt;
- combine mail and Internet modes. Differences between these modes are minimal. Whereas in the United States it is difficult to sample addresses (but not impossible), in Europe, this combination can easily be implemented. Don  Dillman talks about some experiments with this method on the 2009 AAPOR conference (thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pollster.com&#34;&gt;www.pollster.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The second way is to use nonequivalent survey modes (for example the telephone and internet), but design the individual survey questions in such a way that they are still equivalent across modes. This implies that all questions should be simple, short and clear, and that there should be as few answer categories as possible (i.e. yes/no and similar). This means that it would be difficult to ask for attitudes or opinions in such a mixed mode design.&lt;/p&gt;
