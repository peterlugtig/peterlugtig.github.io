      <title>Satisficing in mobile web surveys. Device-effect or selection effect?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I wrote about the fact 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peterlugtig.com/2014/12/what-devices-do-respondents-use-over.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;that respondents in panel surveys are now using tablets and smartphones to complete web surveys&lt;/a&gt;
. We found that in the LISS panel, respondents who use tablets and smartphones are much more likely to switch devices over time and not participate in some months.&lt;br&gt;
The question we actually wanted to answer was a different one: do respondents who complete surveys on their smartphone or mobile give worse answers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we used 6 months of data from the LISS panel, and in each month, coded the User Agent String. We then coded types of satisficing behavior that occur in surveys: the percentage of item missings, whether respondents complete (non-mandatory) open questions, how long their answers were, whether respondents straightline, whether they go for the first answers in a check-all-that-apply questions, and how many answers they click in a check-all-that apply question. We also looked at interview duration, and how much respondents liked the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that respondents on a smartphone seem to do much worse. They take longer to complete the survey, are more negative about the survey, have more item missings, and have a much higher tendency to pick the first answer. On the other questions, differences were small, sometimes in favor of the smartphone user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ugtwA4jujIY/VIYBnhikpVI/AAAAAAAACs4/y_99X9lD1Aw/s1600/Slide1.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ugtwA4jujIY/VIYBnhikpVI/AAAAAAAACs4/y_99X9lD1Aw/s1600/Slide1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click to enlarge: indicators of satisficing per device in LISS survey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this effect due to the fact that the smartphone and tablet are not made to complete surveys, and is satisficing higher because of a device-effect? Or is it a person effect, and are worse respondents more inclined to do a survey on a tablet or smartphone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer this final question, we looked at device-transitions that respondents take within the LISS panel. In the 6 months of the LISS, respondents can make 5 transitions from using 1 device in the one month, to another (or the same) device in the next. For 7 out of 9 transitions (we have too few observations to analyze the tablet -&amp;gt; phone and phone -&amp;gt; tablet transitions), we can then look at the difference in measurement error that is associated with a change in device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xyw5vo1H-28/VIYFOBkuBpI/AAAAAAAACtM/knp91jodOE4/s1600/plotbars3.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xyw5vo1H-28/VIYFOBkuBpI/AAAAAAAACtM/knp91jodOE4/s1600/plotbars3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click to enlarge. Changes in data quality (positive is better) associated with change in device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red bars indicate that there is no significant change in measurement error associated with a device change. Our conclusion is that device changes do not lead to more measurement error, with 2 exceptions:&lt;br&gt;
1. A transition from tablet -&amp;gt; PC or phone -&amp;gt; PC in two consecutive months, leads to a better evaluation of the questionnaire. This implies that the user experience of completing web surveys on a mobile device should be improved.&lt;br&gt;
2. We find that people check more answers in a check-all-that-apply question when they move from a tablet -&amp;gt; PC, or phone -&amp;gt; PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in short. Satisficing seems to be more problematic when surveys are completed on tablets and phones. But this can almost fully be explained by a selection effect. Those respondents who are worse completing surveys, choose to complete surveys more on tablets and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Which devices do respondents use over the course of a panel study?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uu.nl/staff/VToepoel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vera Toepoel&lt;/a&gt;
 and I have been writing a few articles over the last two years about how survey respondents are taking up tablet computers and smartphones. We were interested in studying whether people in a probability-based web panel (
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lissdata.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the LISS panel&lt;/a&gt;
) use different devices over time, and whether siwtches in devices for completing surveys are associated with more or less measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer this question, we have coded the User Agent Strings of the devices used by more than 6.000 respondents over a six month period. (see the publication tab for a syntax on how to do this using R).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find, as others have done, that in every wave about 10% of respondents either use a tablet or smartphone. What is new in our analyses is that we focus on the question whether respondents persistently use the same device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below shows that PC users largely stick to their PC in all waves. For example, we see that 77.4% of PC-respondents in April, again use a PC in May. Only 1.5% of April’s PC respondents switch to either a tablet or smartphone to complete a questionnaire in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table.&lt;/strong&gt; Devices used between April and September 2013 by LISS panel respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GBK0uZ9jCuQ/VH3RelGgypI/AAAAAAAACsg/lKOeVcgPHb0/s1600/lugtig%2Band%2Btoepoel%2Btable%2B1.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GBK0uZ9jCuQ/VH3RelGgypI/AAAAAAAACsg/lKOeVcgPHb0/s1600/lugtig%2Band%2Btoepoel%2Btable%2B1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N = 6,226. Click to enlarge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of respondents switching a PC for either a tablet or smartphone is similarly low in the other months, and is never more than 5%. This stability in device use for PCs is, however, not found for tablets and smartphones. Once people are using a smartphone in particular, they are not very likely to use a smartphone in the next waves of LISS. Only 29 per cent of smartphone users in July 2013, again uses a smartphone in August for example. The consistency of tablet usage increases over the course of the panel; 24% of respondent is a consistent tablet user in April-May, but this increases to 64% in July-August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth to note that the use of either a smartphone or a tablet is more likely to lead to non-participation in the next wave of the survey. This may however be a sample selection effect. More loyal panel members may favor the PC to complete the questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More in a next post on the differences between respondents answer behavior over time, when they switch devices. Do respondents become worse when they answer a survey on a smartphone or tablet?&lt;/p&gt;
