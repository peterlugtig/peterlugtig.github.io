      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine years ago I started blogging. I have been quiet the last few years when it comes to blogging. Perhaps I will pick this up again, perhaps not. What changed quite a bit is how I work as a scientist. I am using R now as my default software for analysis, and have also started to use GitHub for version control, as the cool kids nowadays do.
Anyways, my website was long due an overhaul. Here it is. Thanks to Thom Volker for helping me out with this. The website should be relatively easy to maintain, so, who knows, I may pick up blogging again. These are interesting times for a survey methods person. We are in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak - as I write this I have been at home for over 2 weeks now. As much as I agree with people saying that it really is up to the experts - virologists and epidemiologists - I feel there is a role for sampling theory in making sure that we get as accurate statistics on the proportion of the total population get is infected with SarsCov2. The rather far-reaching public measures to battle Covid-19 should be maintained as long as necessary, but not longer than that. The point when to relax or re-instate measures like social distancing depend very much on what proportion of the total population is infected. I believe one can only really estimate this proportion by taking random samples from the general population, and testing everyone in that sample. However, that should not necessarily be a simple random sample, as seems to be current opinion. It will be much better to stratify on geographic area (as Covid-19 spreads locally) and risk factors such as age. More on that later perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>how to do an exit-poll</title>
      <link>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/how-to-do-exit-poll/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2011 11:05:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/how-to-do-exit-poll/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to do an exit poll, but they all come down to asking people what they voted, right after they went into the voting booth. The first succesfull modern exit poll was conducted in 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.buzzle.com/articles/history-of-exit-polls.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1967 to predict the governor&amp;rsquo;s election of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the difficulties in exit polling, is that some people might not want to say whom they vote for, especially if this person is politically controversial. This might be one of the reasons 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Freedom&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;why Geert Wilders, and the PVV&lt;/a&gt;
 in general always underperform in Dutch exit polls. The second difficulty is selecting a number of polling stations. Good exit polls do this either randomly, or (even better) choose stratified sampling. Stratified sampling is particularly important when voting behavior has a strong regional component. For example, a random selection of polling stations in the Netherlands, might exclude by chance any localities in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Belt_%28Netherlands%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;bible belt&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;
 , where people often vote for the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Political_Party&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SGP&lt;/a&gt;
 leading to a under-represntation of voters for the SGP. Stratifying on past voting behavior in polling stations can 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;increases statistical power&lt;/a&gt;
, making sure we need fewer polling stations to achieve the same margin of error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, exit polls were conducted like this. Slowly, market research firms have first switched to telephone surveys, and later Internet surveys to do their exit poll. Both TNS NIPO and peil.nl relied on their panel to predict the election results. This once again shows how people who voluntarily join access panels can not be used to produce good statistics for the general population.&lt;br&gt;
Wisely, the Dutch news stations (ANP, NOS, RTL) chose to do a proper, old-school exit poll in 2010. See 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/group/nl.politiek/browse_thread/thread/e6f20cdf17ddd6fc?hl=nl&amp;amp;pli=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this post for details&lt;/a&gt;
 (in Dutch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what, one might ask? Why worry about the crappy polls? We can just ignore them, and then focus on the polls that do a good job? Alas, people are heavily influenced by polls in the media in the period leading up to elections. More on this, and strategic voting, next time&lt;/p&gt;
