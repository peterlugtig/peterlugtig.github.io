      <title>Retrospective reporting</title>
      <link>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/retrospective-reporting/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back after a long pause. Panel surveys traditionally interview respondents at regular intervals, for example monthly or yearly. This interval is mostly chosen for practical reasons: interviewing people more frequently would lead to a large respondent burden, and a burden on data processing and dissemination. For these practical reasons, panel surveys often space their interviews one year apart. Many of the changes (e.g. changes in household composition) we as researchers are interested in occur slowly, and annual interviews suffice to capture these changes.&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes we want to get reports at a more detailed level, however. For example, we would like to know how often a respondents visits a doctor (general practitioner) in one year, or when a respondent went on holidays. In order to get at such an estimate, survey researchers can do one of several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. we can ask a respondent to remember all doctor visits in the past year, and rely on &lt;strong&gt;retrospective recall&lt;/strong&gt;. We know that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work very well, because respondents cannot remember all visits. Instead, respondents will rely on rounding, guessing and estimation to come to an estimate.&lt;br&gt;
2. we can ask respondents for visits in say the past month, and rely on &lt;strong&gt;extrapolation&lt;/strong&gt; to get to an annual estimate. This strategy works well if doctor visits are stable throughout the year (which they are not).&lt;br&gt;
3. We can try to break down the year into months, and instead of asking for doctor visits in the last year, ask for doctor visits in each month, reducing the &lt;strong&gt;reference period&lt;/strong&gt;. We can stimulate the retrieval of the correct information further by using a timeline or by the use of landmarks.&lt;br&gt;
4. We can interview respondents more often. So, we conduct 12 monthly interviews instead of one annual interview, thereby reducing both the reference and &lt;strong&gt;recall period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaglasner&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tina Glasner&lt;/a&gt;
 and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/anja-boev%C3%A9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Anja Boeve&lt;/a&gt;
, I recently published a paper that compared methods 1, 3 and 4 within the same study to estimate the total number of doctor (family physician) visits. This study is unique in the sense that we used all three methods within the same respondents, so for each respondents we can see how reporting is different when we rely on annual recall, monthly recall, and on whether we use an annual or monthly reference period. Our study also included an experiment to see whether timelines and landmarks improved recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the full paper 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ijpor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/05/ijpor.edv032&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that respondents give different answers about their doctor visits depending on how we ask them. The estimates for annual visits are;&lt;br&gt;
- annual estimate (1 question): 1.96 visits&lt;br&gt;
- monthly estimate with 12-month recall: 2.62 visits&lt;br&gt;
- monthly estimate with 1-month recall: 3.90 visits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average number of doctor visits in  population registers is 4.66, so the monthly estimate with 1 month-recall periods comes closest to our population estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final step, we were interested in understanding which respondents give different answers depending on the question format. For this, we studied the within-person absolute difference between the monthly estimates with a 12-month and 1-month recall period. The table below shows that the more frequent doctor visits are, the larger the differences between the 1 month and 12-month recall periods. This implies that respondents with more visits tend to underreport them more often when the recall period is long. The same holds for people in moderate and good health. People in bad health often go to the doctor regularly, and remember these visits. More infrequent visits are more easily forgotten. Finally, we find that the results of our experiment are non-significant. Offering respondents personal landmarks, and putting these next to the timeline to improve recall, does not lead to smaller differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aVfXfHTFn90/Vl19JIYKxEI/AAAAAAAACxY/Ec917NXE9eU/s1600/table%2Bfrom%2B%2Bijpor%2B%25282015%2529.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aVfXfHTFn90/Vl19JIYKxEI/AAAAAAAACxY/Ec917NXE9eU/s640/table%2Bfrom%2B%2Bijpor%2B%25282015%2529.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, these findings may be useful when one is interested in estimating frequencies of behavior over an annual period. Breaking up the &amp;lsquo;annual-estimate&amp;rsquo; question into twelve monthly questions helps to improve data quality. Asking about such frequencies at 12 separate occasions further helps, but this is unlikely to be feasible due to the large increased costs of more frequent data collection. In self-administered web-surveys this might however be feasible. Splitting up questionnaires into multiple shorter ones may not only reduce burden, but can increase data quality for specific survey questions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Longitudinal interview outcome data reduction: Latent Class and Sequence analyses</title>
      <link>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/longitudinal-interview-outcome-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2013 16:22:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/longitudinal-interview-outcome-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frauke Kreuter once commented on a presentation I gave that I should really be looking at sequence analysis for studying attrition in panel surveys. She had written an article on the topic with Ulrich Kohler (
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jos.nu/Articles/abstract.asp?article=252203&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
) in 2009, and as of late there are more people exploring the technique (e.g. Mark Hanly at Bristol, and 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.southampton.ac.uk/demography/about/staff/gbd.page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gabi Durrant at Southampton&lt;/a&gt;
).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am working on a project on attrition in the British Household Panel, and linking attrition errors to measurement errors. Attrition data can be messy. Below, you see the response outcome sequences of every initial panel member in the British Household Panel Survey. This figure obscures the fact individual respondents may frequently switch states (e.g. interview - noncontact - interview - refusal - not issued).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JQnC4Q1FXFw/Une6AMXsrHI/AAAAAAAACn0/sfGgWexzVlA/s1600/Plot&amp;#43;all&amp;#43;sequences&amp;#43;BHPS.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JQnC4Q1FXFw/Une6AMXsrHI/AAAAAAAACn0/sfGgWexzVlA/s400/Plot+all+sequences+BHPS.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;relative sizes of final interview outcomes at 18 waves of BHPS of wave 1 respondents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although descriptive visualizations like these are informative, sequence analysis becomes analytically interesting when you try to &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; something with the sequences of information. In my case, I want to group all sequence chains into &amp;ldquo;clusters&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;classes&amp;rdquo; of people who have a similar process of attrition. 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0111&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stata&lt;/a&gt;
 and 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mephisto.unige.ch/traminer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R TraMineR&lt;/a&gt;
 offer possibilities for doing this. Both packages enable you to match sequences by 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_matching&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;optimal matching&lt;/a&gt;
, so that for every sequence from every person you get a distance measure to every other sequence (person). In turn, this (huge) dustance matrix can then be used to classify all the sequences of all respondents into clusters. R offers a nice way to handle huge data matrices, by using aggregation and weighting by the way. See the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mephisto.unige.ch/weightedcluster/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WeightedCluster&lt;/a&gt;
 library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, you find the results of the sequence analysis. The nice thing is that I end up with 6 clusters that look the same as the Classes that I got out of a Latent Class Analysis over summer. So now I feel much more confident using this classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5-Z64s2GcV4/Une6APMFHsI/AAAAAAAACoA/JQ-QJeO7S0A/s1600/6-cluster&amp;#43;solution&amp;#43;from&amp;#43;sequence&amp;#43;analysis&amp;#43;on&amp;#43;BHPS&amp;#43;attrition&amp;#43;data.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5-Z64s2GcV4/Une6APMFHsI/AAAAAAAACoA/JQ-QJeO7S0A/s640/6-cluster+solution+from+sequence+analysis+on+BHPS+attrition+data.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: 6-cluster solution for sequence analysis on BHPS attrition patterns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences between sequence analysis and LCA are really minimal, and probably result from the fact that the Optimal Matching algorithm used in sequence analysis is more flexible (in that it would allow deletion, additions, substitutions etc to match), than Latent Class Analysis. But in practice, for my analyses, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what technique I use. My results are equivalent. Personally, I like Latent Class analysis more, because it offers the option of linking the Latent Classes of attrition to substantive research data in one model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attrition data bear a resemblence to contact data recorded in a telephone or face-to-face survey. Interviewers make call or interview attempts, that bear a lot of information about the survey proecess, and could improve fieldwork, and reduce nonresponse and costs. I am imagining a paper where one links contact data at every wave, and combines that with attrition analyses, in a series of linked-sequence data analysis. That way, you can learn how specific sequences of call and contact data, lead to specific sequences of interview outcomes at later stages of the panel survey. It can be done if you have a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonresponse Workshop 2013</title>
      <link>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/nonresponse-workshop-2013/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2013 16:48:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/nonresponse-workshop-2013/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges in survey research are declining response rates. Around the globe, it appears to become harder and harder to convince people to participate in surveys. As to why response rates are declining, researchers are unsure. A general worsening of the &amp;lsquo;survey climate&amp;rsquo;, due to increased time pressures on people in general, and direct marketing are usually blamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nonresponse.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nonresponse workshop&lt;/a&gt;
 was held in London last week. This was the 24th edition, and all we talk about at the workshop is how to predict, prevent or adjust for nonreponse in panel surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we are all concerned about declining nonresponse rates, presenters at the nonresponse workshop have found throughout the years that nonresponse cannot be predicted using respondent characteristics. The explained variance of any model rarely exceeds 0.20. Because of this, we don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to predict or adjust for nonresponse either. We fortunately also find that generally, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/72/2/167.short&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the link between nonresponse rates and nonresponse bias is wea&lt;/a&gt;
k. In other words, high nonresponse rates are not per se biasing our substantive research findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this year&amp;rsquo;s nonresponse workshop presentations focused on two topics. At other survey methods conferences (
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ESRA&lt;/a&gt;
, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peterlugtig.com/2013/05/aapor-2013.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AAPOR&lt;/a&gt;
) I see a similar trend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Noncontacts:&lt;/strong&gt; where refusals can usually be not predicted at all (explained variances lower than 0.10), noncontacts can to some extent. So, presentations focused on:&lt;br&gt;
- increasing contact rates among &amp;lsquo;difficult&amp;rsquo; groups&lt;br&gt;
- Using paradata, and call record data to improve the prediction of contact times, and succesful contacts.&lt;br&gt;
- Using responsive designs, where the contact strategies is changed, based on pre-defined (and often experimental) strategies for subgroups in your populations (
&lt;a href=&#34;http://jameswagnersurv.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/responsive-design-and-adaptive-design.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;adaptive designs&lt;/a&gt;
), and paradata during fieldwork using decision-rules (
&lt;a href=&#34;http://jameswagnersurv.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/responsive-design-and-adaptive-design.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;responsive designs)&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=7827313755221690631&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LsN6mFofS6k/Ui4Q3EI4XCI/AAAAAAAACmk/-Ga_L9ZC6ag/s1600/cartoon.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LsN6mFofS6k/Ui4Q3EI4XCI/AAAAAAAACmk/-Ga_L9ZC6ag/s400/cartoon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Responsive designs can be used to increase response rates or limit nonresponse bias. However, they can also be used to limit survey costs. If respondents can be contacted with fewer contact attempts, this saves money. Similarly, we can limit the amount of effort we put into groups of cases for which we already have a high response rate, and devote our resources to hard-to-get cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many interesting studies than can be done into both these areas. With time, I think we will see that succesful stratgies will be developed that limit noncontact rates, nonresponse and even nonresponse bias to some extent. Also, survey might become cheaper using responsive designs, especially if the surveys use Face-to-Face or telephone interviewing. At this year&amp;rsquo;s workshop, there were no presentations on using a responsive design approach for converting soft refusals. But I can see the field moving in that direction too eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one note of general disappointment with myself and our field remains after attending the workshop (and I&amp;rsquo;ve had this feeling before):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we cannot predict nonresponse at all, and if we find that nonresponse generally has a weak effect on our survey estimates, what are we doing wrong? What are we not understanding? It feels, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;in philosophical terms,&lt;/a&gt;
 as if we survey methodologists are perhaps all using the wrong paradigm for studying and understanding the problem. Perhaps we need radically different ideas, and analytical models to study the problem of nonresponse. What these should be is perhaps anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess. And if not anyone&amp;rsquo;s, at least my guess.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interested in new mixed mode research project?</title>
      <link>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/interested-in-new-mixed-mode-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2013 15:04:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://peterlugtig.github.io/post/interested-in-new-mixed-mode-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mixed-mode research is still a hot topic among survey methodologists. At least at about every meeting I attend (some selection bias is likely here). Although we know a lot from experiments in the last decade, there is also a lot we don&amp;rsquo;t know. For example, what designs reduce total survey error most? What is the optimal mix of survey modes when data quality and survey costs are both important? And, how can we compare mixed-mode studies across time, or countries, when the proportions of mode assignments changes over time or vary between countries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with some researchers at National Statistical Institutes I am trying to form a European consortium to set up a programme for doing comparative mixed-mode research. One of the goals of this consortium would be to apply for funding at the next wave of EU funding (horizon 2020). We are however still looking for researchers in market research, official statistics and universities. And especially from countries in Northern, Central and Southern Europe. Want to know more? Write me at p.lugtig AT uu.nl&lt;/p&gt;

Some colleagues in the United Kingdom have started a half-year initiative to discuss the possibilities of conducting web surveys among the general population. Their website can be found 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natcen.ac.uk/genpopweb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of their discussions focused on whether any web survey among the population should be complemented with another, secondary survey mode. This would for example enable those without Internet access to participate.  Obviously, this means mixing survey modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using two different survey modes to collect survey data, risks introducing extra survey error. Methodologists (me inclusive) have worked hard on getting a grip on the existence of differences in measurement effects between different modes. In order to study these properly, one should first make sure that the sub samples that are interviewed in different survey modes, do not differ just because of differences in selection effects between the two samples. I have written some earlier posts on this issue, see some of the labels in the word-cloud on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have composed a short presentation on ways in which differences in measurement effects in mixed-mode surveys can be studied. The full presentation is 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2839696/Lugtig%20-%20measurement%20effects%20in%20mixed-mode%20panel%20surveys%20%28online%20version%29.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
. Comments are very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In going over the literature, two things stood out, that I never realised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. There are few well-conducted studies on measurement effects in mixed-mode surveys. Those that exist show that there often are difference in means, and sometimes in variances of survey statistics. Yet no one (and I&amp;rsquo;d love to be corrected here), has looked at the effect on covariances. That is, do relations between the key variables in a study change, just because of the mode of data collection?  There may be an analogy to nonresponse studies, where we often find bias on means and variances, but much smaller biases for covariances. In this picture, this reflects the relation between x1 and y1 in two different survey modes. Is that relation different because of mode effects? Probably not, but we need more research on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O5es4HfiUG0/US82gjAFQ0I/AAAAAAAACjg/X7ZX1e8m0mk/s1600/correction&amp;#43;for&amp;#43;measurement&amp;#43;effects.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O5es4HfiUG0/US82gjAFQ0I/AAAAAAAACjg/X7ZX1e8m0mk/s400/correction+for+measurement+effects.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. What to do about mode effects? We are perhaps not ready for answering this question, looking at how little we know exactly about how measurement differences between modes affect survey statistics. But we should start thinking in general about this question. Can we correct for differences between modes. Should we want to do that? It would create a huge extra burden on survey researchers to study mode differences in all mixed-mode surveys, and designing correction methods for them. Could it be that in five years time, we have concluded that it is probably best to try to keep mode effects as small as possible and not worry about the rest?&lt;/p&gt;
