## Introduction

In week 8 we discussed model-assisted survey inference. This week we go one step further and discuss model-based approaches. A statistical model is used as the basis for performing inference; inclusion probabilities no longer play a role.

## Lecture
We review the U.S. presidential dataset again. How does one design a good inference model? The Total Survey Error Model is reviewed, with a focus on non-probability based datasets

## Class and Take home exercises
Can you model? We introduce a short competition. Who can design the best model?
