## Introduction

In the week where ‘designed’ big data was discussed as a concept, the integration of design-based surveys with ‘Big data’  stemming from data donation, sensors, or other sources has already been discussed as a way to do inference in a world where there are more and more data.
In data integration we more generally try to combine and integrate data to improve inference. Whereas in designed big data multiple data sources are collected for the same individuals, we will this week discuss several approaches that integrate data that are collected in different people

## Lecture
Discussion and examples of the following approaches:
- Integrating probability and nonprobability surveys to minimize TSE
- Integrating micro-data and aggregate data
- Is there a general methodology for data integration, and inference for the 21st century?
