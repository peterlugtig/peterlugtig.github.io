## Introduction

Hand in written final report (graded 50%). This assignment will be graded using the rubric posted on Blackboard. Three of the rubrics here concern the presentation and discussion of week 15. All students in the group normally get the same grade. However, it may be the case that some members of the group get a higher or lower grade depending on their performance in the group work as judged by the course coordinator.
