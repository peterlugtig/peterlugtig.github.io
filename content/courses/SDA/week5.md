## Introduction

In practice, real surveys seldomly use a simple random sampling design. We will discuss why stratification is often used to make the sample more efficient (allowing smaller samples), and why clustering is used to limit survey costs.

## Literature 

- Stuart (1984) p. 35-71

## Lecture
We start by discussing the Take home exercise. After this, we illustrate the benefits of stratification for survey efficiency and clustering for survey costs using example data.

## Class exercise
Specify a stratified and clustering design in R

## Take home exercise
Review the survey documentation of your adopted design-based survey (see week 1). Work out the sampling design on paper (not in R!), and bring the results to class.
