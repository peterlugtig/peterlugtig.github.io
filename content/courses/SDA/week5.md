## Introduction

In practice, real surveys seldomly use a simple random sampling design. We will discuss why stratification is often used to make the sample more efficient (allowing smaller samples), and why clustering is used to limit survey costs.

## Lecture
We start by discussing the Take home exercise. After this, we illustrate the benefits of stratification for survey efficiency and clustering for survey costs using example data.
