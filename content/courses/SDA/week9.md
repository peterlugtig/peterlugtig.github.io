## Introduction

Every survey suffers from nonresponse. Nonresponse rates are often large and are thought to be often the largest source of survey error. As long as information for the entire population or sample is available, nonresponse error can to some degree be assessed and adjusted for.

## Lecture
We discuss how nonresponse can be assessed and nonresponse correction factors (weights) can be computed based on either target population or sample frame data. We discuss weighting by poststratification, linear weighting and raking.
