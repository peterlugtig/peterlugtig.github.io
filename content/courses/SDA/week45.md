## Introduction

Topic: in practice, nonresponse weights should be developed keeping in mind what the dependent variable is. In situations where many variables asked among respondents are also available for the population, there are many possible nonresponse weighting models. In this week, we will focus on the question of how to develop nonresponse weights. We discuss the concept of ‘paradata’

**Prepare for class:** 
-	Brick, J. M. (2013). Unit nonresponse and weighting adjustments: A critical review. Journal of Official Statistics, 29(3), 329-353.
-	Kreuter, F. (2013). Improving surveys with paradata: Introduction. Improving surveys with paradata: Analytic uses of process information, 1-9.

**Lecture:** introduction to paradata. 

**Class exercise:** discussion about possible weighting variables given different dependent variables that are often of interest to scientists (e.g. voting behavior, attitudes towards vaccination).

**Take home Exercise:** R exercises where you develop your own weights for a survey conducted in the Netherlands.

**Before week 46**

For the final assignment you will work in a group of about 4 (+- 1) on a real-life dataset. The goal is to apply all the materials covered in the course, answer a substantive research question and solve a ‘challenge’ that covers an advanced problem in survey research. You will receive an e-mail on your @students.uu.nl account with more information about group membership, the assignment itself and your group members this week.
