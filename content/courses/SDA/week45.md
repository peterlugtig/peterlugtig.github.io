## Introduction

Covering all materials from weeks 37-44 (slides, readings and exercises). The exam consists of an open-book Take-home exam. The exam will be available on Blackboard at 09:00. You then have until 14:00 to finish the exam, but I do not expect anyone to work for more than 3 hours on the exam, giving you about two hours for breaks and/or unexpected problems (i.e. coffee breaks, Internet problems, R issues, people ringing your doorbell etc.).

**You will need:**

- A computer including R and MS word, connected to the Internet.

**Content of the exam:** For some questions you will receive input in the form of .R syntax. Based on a dataset that will be generated using R-syntax, some questions will concern the syntax itself, the dataset, and an interpretation of the results of several analyses performed on the dataset. You will thus not be required to write R-syntax during the exam, but will be required to run analyses, and slightly adapt the syntax, as well as understand the results as they are presented in R. You will also receive some theoretical problems (cases) where you are asked to reflect and use concepts covered in the course, and apply these to the theoretical problems. You may use the literature, slides, exercises, R, and the Internet to come up with your answers. You complete the answers in an answer sheet in MS Word and send the exam back by e-mail. You will receive a confirmation of receipt by e-mail. Wait for this confirmation before turning your computer off. In case there are issues during the exam, please send an e-mail to the course coordinator who will be on stand-by to help

**What can I not do:**

- You are NOT allowed to contact your fellow students, or other human beings for help. In case answers are identical or very similar, this will be regarded as fraud. In case the answers of two students appear just similar (suspicious), the teacher will ask the respective students to participate in an extra individual oral exam.

**Before week 46**

For the final assignment you will work in a group of about 4 (+- 1) on a real-life dataset. The goal is to apply all the materials covered in the course, answer a substantive research question and solve a ‘challenge’ that covers an advanced problem in survey research. You will receive an e-mail on your @students.uu.nl account with more information about group membership, the assignment itself and your group members this week.
