## Introduction

Under a design-based model for inference, the process of drawing a sample is important. It is also the part of the research cycle that is entirely under the control of the researcher; nonresponse for example is much less so. Sampling is an important element of statistics and is therefore discussed in some detail in this course. In this week we focus on the most fundamental sampling principle, where every element of the population has an equal, non-zero chance of being selected into the sample.
