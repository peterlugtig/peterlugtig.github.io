I teach an annual summerschool lasting five days titled: [Advanced survey design](https://www.uu.nl/professionals/programmas/advanced-survey-design). It is usually scheduled in teh first week of September and lasts 5 full days.

The course in survey design takes student beyond the introductory courses offered in BA and MA programmes, and discusses the state-of-the-art of one of the most important data collection techniques: surveys. The course focuses on the methodology of how to do surveys, and the use statistical techniques to analyse and correct for some specific survey errors. It combines short 1-hour lectures with exercises on most of the topics discussed. We assume course participants are proficient in working with R. Most of the exercises can also be done with STATA or SPSS, but answers will be provided in R
The course assumes basic knowledge of:
- Basic knowledge of social science research methodology
- Multivariate statistics up to the General Linear Model
- The basics of survey methodology (the basic of sampling questionnaire design, collecting and processing data)

Consultations with teachers of the course to discuss your survey questions in more depth. 
You may bring your own dataset, questionnaire or study design to discuss. 
Alternatively, there is time to finish some of the exercises earlier or read specific literature
