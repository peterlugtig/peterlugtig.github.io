23-07 I've changed some things around, integrating my weblog posts with a new personal homepage, where I intend to assemble everything that is now still to be found on diverse pages, as Linked-in, the Utrecht University homepage, and stuff that is just out there on the web. Keep visiting this page, as it will undergo major changes in the next months!  
  
31-07 Switched the entire homepage to english, and have added a list of downloadable publications.  
  
25-08 Further changes and news will be listed under the "news and agenda" page
