Three weeks ago, I wrote about the fact that I think that it would be great if we could have [a journal on peer-reviewed datasets](http://www.peterlugtig.com/2013/09/publish-your-data.html) (along with data being accessible).  
  
It seems I am not alone thinking this. [Jelte Wicherts,](http://wicherts.socsci.uva.nl/) a psychologist/statistician atTilburg University has just started the [Journal of Open Psychology data](http://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/article/view/1).

"The Journal of Open Psychology Data (JOPD) features peer reviewed data papers describing psychology datasets with high reuse potential.Â Data papers may describe data from unpublished work, including replication research, or from papers published previously in a traditional journal. We are working with a number of specialist and institutional data repositories to ensure that the associated data are professionally archived, preserved, and openly available. Equally importantly, the data and the papers are citable, and reuse is tracked.
