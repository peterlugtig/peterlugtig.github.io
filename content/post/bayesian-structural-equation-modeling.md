In August, I organised a three-week summerschool with my colleagues in Utrecht on new features in MPLUS 7, the software we use to build Structural Equation Models. Video's of all lectures can be found [here.](http://mplus.fss.uu.nl/)  
  
The [latest issue](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=browsePA.volumes&jcode=met) of Psychological Methods contains background reading of Bayesian SEM, which is the main new feature of SEM. I find this fascinating stuff, and can think of hundreds of articles that could be written about replications of Maximum Likelihood based approaches.  
  
I think this is gonna be extremely interesting to survey methodologists as well, because any parametric model (for example models where variances are assumed to have a normal distribution, or factor loadings are assumed to be equal across the sample), can now be estimated as a non-parametric model. This will be huge, I promise.
