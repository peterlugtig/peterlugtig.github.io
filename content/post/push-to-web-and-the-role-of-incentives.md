With [Vera Toepoel](http://www.uu.nl/staff/VToepoel), and [people at NIDI] (www.nidi.knaw.nl) and the [German Institiute for Demographic Research] (https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Startseite.html) we have in 2018 conducted a large experiment to tranfer the Gender and Generations Survey (www.ggp-i.org) to a push-to-web survey. Several papers will document what we did, and what particular designs worked and did not work.These papers will come out later in 2021, and I may publish some more posts about this design. In this post I want to focus on the role of incentives in push-to-web surveys.

Incentives are commonly used in surveys nowadays. Online panels for example 'pay' respondents for their time. When they complete a survey they either receive 'points'  they can redeem at a shop, while some probability-based online panels (like www.lissdata.nl) periodically pay for every completed questionnaire by direct debit. Incentives here serve as conditional rewards for participation.

There is a large body of literature +++
