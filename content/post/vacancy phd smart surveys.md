Are you interested in surveys, official statistics, apps, and sensors and do you have the ambition to contribute to scientific progress as well as perform socially relevant research? Then a PhD position at the department of Methodology and Statistics of Utrecht University & Statistics Netherlands (CBS) might be just the right job for you.
 
You will work on a project “Push-to-app: Effective recruitment and retention in smart surveys”. With the increased use of smart devices such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home sensors by individuals, using these devices for data collection is a next logical step for official statistics. The demand for timely and high-quality data to aid policy making can no longer be met through traditional (face-to-face, telephone, online) surveys as response rates are continuously falling. Thus, exorbitant methods of novel data collection are needed. Most potential is promised by augmenting self-report with sensor measurement, using smartphones and other devices. Official statistics has started integrating sensor measurement, using smartphones in data collection. There is already an existing infrastructure with open-source transparent modular apps developed for the CBS travel survey, household budget survey, and the time use survey.

However, the first studies that collect information about the general population, using sensors and apps, show that initial participation rates are still not ideal. Moreover, noncompliance is a challenge with participants not providing information once the app is installed. The main research question of the PhD is: How to obtain high and balanced completion rates in surveys employing smart features. The corresponding goals of this PhD are:

  - to consolidate the existing knowledge about the novel data collection methods;
  - to obtain an in-depth understanding of participation and retention;
  - to provide usable recommendations that are ready to be implemented into the data production process of official statistics.

 
The PhD project will build upon existing knowledge that has been obtained from the WIN research programme (a CBS and UU collaboration) and international projects funded by Eurostat, it will provide an integral in-depth look at the sensor-and-app data collection lifecycle. Today, data collection systems become more complex and multi-source: mixed-mode multi-device surveys with high-frequency Experience Sampling measurement and potentially always-on sensor components, with an option to link to auxiliary data and donate digitally collected personal data from digital platforms, apps, wearables or smart devices. Such augmentation of surveys and replacement of questions results in complex designs with multi-stage recruitment and consent procedures.
 
*Outline of the project*
The data quality of the components of data collection systems will be assessed by applying an adapted Total Survey Error framework. The individual studies will focus on optimizing recruitment and retention. Four studies are foreseen. The candidate will help shape the studies, the description below is meant as a tentative work programme.

The first study will be a meta-analytic review of the existing app-and-sensor projects, both conducted in the past by CBS (e.g., the travel app study, consent experiment, physical activity tracking) along with studies with international partners (e.g., Household Budget Survey with Luxemburg and Spain), as well as other international studies (IAB SMART, UK Understanding Society’s app, etc.). The aim of this study is to identify which features of recruitment and retention strategies yield increased participation and retention. The results of this study will inform the remaining three studies.

The second study will focus on improving recruitment success. From previous (experimental) studies we know that privacy concerns play a central role in obtaining participants’ consent to novel data collection and data donation. However, it is not well-understood yet how to gain participants’ trust and how to mitigate privacy concerns for different types of smart (i.e., app and sensor collected) data. Sharing geolocation for a travel survey involves different decision making than taking pictures of receipts for a budget survey, for example. The donation of Google History Location data involves yet other considerations. This study will use a mixed-methods approach with a qualitative component of in-depth interviews with (a) selected participants about reasons for nonparticipation and (b) interviewers about their observations during the recruitment process.

The third study will investigate methods to increase retention and methods to increase donation of already existing digital data as an additional task. The focus of this study will be on increasing participants’ motivation by providing feedback about the data that is provided by a participant. Existing studies focus on promising feedback to improve recruitment rates, or incentives. Providing personalized feedback to a participant about the data that they are sharing can be a cost-efficient way to increase retention, and a way to increase transparency, hence also increasing participant’s trust which seems to be crucial to participation in novel data collection. Within this study, a detailed look will be taken at the motivation of participating in app-based data collection. Tailored feedback can be implemented into one of the existing app infrastructures of CBS or outsourced. This project will also link to the PDI SSH “Digital Data Donation Infrastructure (D3I)” project on data donation.  

The fourth study will focus on tailoring the recruitment strategies to maximize both recruitment success (push-to-app) and retention, building on the findings from studies two and three. Using the administrative data linked to the prior sensor survey data (e.g., Household Budget Survey), the PhD candidate will identify hard-to-recruit groups and set up an experimental study to tailor the recruitment strategy (e.g., prior communication materials making certain study features salient to the participant, incentives, interviewer assistance, and other features identified as relevant in study one) to a participant based on the observable (demographic, regional) characteristics. Further, tailoring strategies to increase continued data collection will be developed for the groups of individuals that are less likely to comply as identified from prior studies (part of study one).
 
*Anticipated output*
As a result of each of the studies, the candidate will – as part of or in addition to scientific articles – produce a set of actionable recommendations that can be implemented into the data collection practices at CBS and inform the operations of the international partners.
 
*The PhD position*
The PhD candidate will be appointed at the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. As the PhD position is a joint venture between Utrecht University and Statistics Netherlands, a guest appointment at Statistics Netherlands will be created as well. Within the guest appointment access to microdata will be arranged both through on-site and remotely. We expect the successful candidate to be willing to work at Statistics Netherlands in The Hague for one day a week (or more) and be willing to occasionally travel to the CBS office in Heerlen from which all data collection is coordinated.

Your work will also include some teaching activities. Of course, you will be well guided and supported by your supervisor.
