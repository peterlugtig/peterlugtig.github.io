Gerry Nicolaas (of Natcen) has just written a good review on the nonresponse workshop we both attended this year. See [http://natcenblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/challenges-to-current-practice-of.html#comment-form](http://natcenblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/challenges-to-current-practice-of.html#comment-form)  
The Nonresponse Workshops are a great place to meet and discuss with survey researchers in a small setting. The next workshop is to be held early september 2012 at Statistics Canada. See www.nonresponse.org
