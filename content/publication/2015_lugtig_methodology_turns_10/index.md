abstract: "Since its inception in February 2005, Methodology, the official journal of the European Association of Methodology, has been an online journal with a strong European vocation and dedication ‘‘to promote research and the development of empirical research methods in the fields of behavioral, social, educational, health and economic sciences, as well as in the field of evaluation research’’ (Ato & Eid, 2005; Ato & Hox, 2009). In 2009, the then editors of Methodology, Manuel Ato and Joop Hox, wrote an editorial in which they looked back at the first 4 years of Methodology (Ato & Hox, 2009). Now, 6 years later, two different editors, Peter Lugtig of Utrecht University and Nekane Balluerka of the University of the Basque Country, have taken over the editorship of Methodology. As Methodology celebrates its 10th birthday, it is time to look back and forward."
