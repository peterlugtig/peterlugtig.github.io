abstract: "The quasi-simplex model  makes use of at least three  repeated  measures of the same variable to estimate  its  reliability. The  model has  rather strict  assumptions  about how  various  parameters  in the model are related to each other. Previous studies have outlined how several of the assumptions of the quasi-simplex model may be relaxed using more than 3 waves of data. It is unclear however whether the assumptions of the quasi-simplex model are overlystrict. In other words, it is not known whether relaxing  the assumptions  results  in  better  models  or different substantive  conclusions  with regard  to the  reliability  of  survey  measures.  Using  data  from  theBritish  Household  Panel  Surveythis  paper shows how the assumptions of the quasi-simplex model can be relaxed. We conclude that relaxing the assumptions  in  practice  seldom  leads  to  a  better  model  or  different  conclusions  than  the  traditional quasi-simplex model."
