abstract: "Nonresponse in surveys is particularly problematic among young people in both cross-sectional and panel studies. This article investigates the factors
driving lower participation rates among young people in longitudinal surveys.
We study whether nonresponse can be explained by young people experiencing more life events associated with disengagement from panel surveys.
Using data from the Understanding Society panel in the United Kingdom, we employ a discrete-time multinomial logistic hazard model to study nonresponse
across panel waves. Consistent with previous research, our analysis identifies lower education, unemployment, immigrant background, and residential circumstances as key predictors of nonresponse. Furthermore, we demonstrate that changes in employment status and (expectations of) residential relocation significantly contribute to predicting attrition among young participants, with age remaining a significant factor. Living with parents also plays an important role, as it is associated with a lower risk of non-contact."
