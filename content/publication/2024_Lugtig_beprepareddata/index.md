abstract: "This dataset stems from the project ‘Beprepared’: (https://be-prepared-consortium.nl/) which aims to provide in-depth analyses of mixed-method behavioural science data collected throughout the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and inform preparedness strategies for future outbreaks. In approaching the research from a behavioural and social science perspective, researchers focus on four main themes:

·       Prevention behaviour, psychosocial and contextual determinants, and (communication) interventions
·       Resilience and engagement of citizens, communities and organisations
·       Research methodology and preparedness
·       Effective and integrated policy advice

This resource links to the theme ‘research methodology’ and provides an overview of datasets that have been used internationally to study the behavioral effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. These datasources can be used to study how people behave in a variety of settings during the Covid pandemic and so to inform policy-makers, but also to study the effects of behavioral interventions. It includes datasources that for example study mobility behavior at a regional or national level, physical distancing in public, health adherence behaviors (like handwashing, mask wearing), social contacts on- and offline, purchasing behaviors (shopping) etc."
