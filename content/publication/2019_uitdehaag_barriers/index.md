abstract: "Background:

Nurses and certified nursing assistants (CNA) have a crucial role in 24/7 continuity of palliative care for many vulnerable patients and families, however, their perspective has been largely omitted in reported barriers to palliative care.
Aim:

To describe barriers to ideal palliative care that are specific to nurses and CNAs working in all care settings.
Methods:

A cross-sectional, online survey was distributed to members of the Dutch Nurses' Association.
Findings:

Almost 50% of the participating 2377 nurses and CNAs experienced more than five barriers to ideal palliative care in their work situation; nurses and CNAs employed in regional hospitals, mental healthcare and nursing home settings encountered more barriers than those working in other settings.
Conclusion:

The three most common barriers were: lack of proactive care planning, lack of internal consultation possibilities and lack of assessment of care recipients' preferences and needs for a seamless transition to another setting."
