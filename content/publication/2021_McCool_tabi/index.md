abstract: "Advances in smartphone technology have allowed for individuals to have access to nearcontinuous
location tracking at a very precise level. As the backbone of mobility research, the
Travel Diary Study, has continued to offer decreasing response rates over the years,
researchers are looking to these mobile devices to bridge the gap between self-report recall
studies and a personâ€™s underlying travel behavior. This article details an open-source
application that collects real-time location data which respondents may then annotate to
provide a detailed travel diary. Results of the field test involving 674 participants are
discussed, including technical performance, data quality and response rate."
