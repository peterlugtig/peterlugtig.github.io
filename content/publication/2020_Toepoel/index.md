abstract: "In this paper we discuss the implications of using mobile devices for online survey completion. With more and more people accessing online surveys on mobile devices, online surveys need to be redesigned in order to be able to meet the characteristics of mobile device usage, such as small screens and short messaging. We discuss mobile friendly design by focussing on survey layout, the length of the survey, special features, and the decision of making the survey app or browser based. Further, we discuss the different sensors that can be used to augment or replace survey questions, and respondentsâ€™ willingness to share sensor data. We end with three examples of surveys conducted by Statistics Netherlands, where sensors are used for active and passive measurement in mobile surveys."
