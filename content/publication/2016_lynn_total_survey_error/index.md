abstract: "This article describes the application of the total survey error paradigm to longitudinal surveys. Several aspects of survey error, and of the interactions between different types of  error, are distinct in the longitudinal survey context. Furthermore, error trade-off decisions in survey design and implementation are subject to some unique considerations. Previous literature on total survey error mostly fails to explicitly consider uniquely longitudinal issues. We aim to show how uniquely longitudinal sources of error in surveys should be understood within the Total Survey Error framework and we provide examples of studies of some of the unique interactions between errors."
