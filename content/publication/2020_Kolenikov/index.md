abstract: "We  document  our  understanding  of,  and  recommendations  for,  appropriate  best  practices  in documenting the complex sampling design settings for statistical software that enables design-based analyses of survey data. We discuss features of complex sample survey data such as stratification, clustering, unequal probabilities of selection, and calibration, and outline their impact on estimation procedures. We provide assessment guidelines and a checklist that will aid complex sample survey data  providers  in  aligning  their  level  of  documentation  with  best practices  andshow  how  existing surveys and their documentation score based on these guidelines."
