The WIN project was set up in 2016 and had the goal to design and test innovative data collection strategies in social research. WIN stands for 'Waarneem Innovatie Netwerk', which in english means 'Data collection Innovation Network. The project was set up as a collaborative project between the data quality group at Utrecht University, and Statistics Netherlands. The focus of the project was on how to use  mobile phones and wearable devices to improve  the collection of human behavior data, and improve official statistics. We have developed our own open-source smartphone app system, and published many articles. The project was finished after 10 succesful years in 2025.

As part of our work, we have developed our own open-source smartphone app. The app works cross-platform, and is used to collect data on travel, budget expenditure, and time use.
The source code can be found in a [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/tabi). Sub-projects include the app itself, the backend to collect measured data and a documentation folder. Feel free to fork it and build your own. We still greatly appreciate any code contributions, patches, bugfixes or comments, because the app will continue to be used in regular data collection at Statistics Netherlands.

##Outputs:
The project has resulted in about 40 different publications. Below is an incomplete overview. Direct links to the publications, syntax etc. [can be found here](www.peterlugtig.com/publications#cbs)
