The [European Social Survey (ESS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) is the largest European Research Infrastructure in the social sciences. Historically, the survey has been carried out every two years in about 30 countries using face-to-face interviewing. The ESS is moving to self-completion (combination of web + paper) as the interview mode. I advise them on issues regarding the effects on data quality; in particular effects on comparability of ESS data across time, and between countries. 
In 2023-2024 I did consulting work for the ESS, and since 2025 I am a member of the Core Scientific Team, being responsible for work around the mixed-mode transition. In particular I focus on the analysis of mode nonresponse and mode measurement effects, and will produce training and guidance for ESS users on how to use the mixed-mode data
  
Two reports were produced in 2025. Further outputs of this project are expected in the period 2026-2029, and [can be found here](https://www.peterlugtig.com/tags/ESS/).
