In this panel discussion at @GESIS, in context of the [KODAQS project](https://www.gesis.org/en/research/external-funding-projects/kodaqs-project-page), a panel discussion one important aspect of data quality: representation. To this end,I discuss with [Henning Silber](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=gOqSyi0AAAAJ&hl=de), [Stephanie Eckman](https://stepheckman.com/) and [Barbara Felderer](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/about-us/staff/person/Barbara.Felderer) the nuts and bolts of representation and sampling, including the notion of good representation, ways to achieve or to measure it, challenges on the way towards good representation, probabilistic and non-probabilistic samples, and innovative ways to supplement traditional survey data.
