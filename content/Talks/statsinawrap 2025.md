In this episode of Eurostat’s Stats in a Wrap podcast we investigate how partnering with academia drives statistical innovation that makes data gathering smarter, faster and more effective.

Our guests reveal how collaboration between universities and statistical institutes in EU countries is transforming the way data are collected and processed. From using smartphones to simplify surveys to utilising AI for faster analysis and error detection, innovation is reshaping official statistics.
