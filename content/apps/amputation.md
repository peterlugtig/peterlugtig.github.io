With [Gerko Vink](https://github.com/gerkovink) and [Rianne Schouten](https://rianneschouten.github.io/), we developed a procedure to create multivariate missing data. The idea is that this procedure can be used to for example generate missing data for simulation studies, or inform the design of a matrix-survey (also called modular design) questionnaire.
